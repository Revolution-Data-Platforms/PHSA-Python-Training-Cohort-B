# Strings

Strings in Python are sequences of characters. They are immutable, which means that once created, they cannot be changed. Strings are created by enclosing characters in quotes. Single quotes (`'...'`) and double quotes (`"..."`) are both used to denote strings, however, it is best to be consistent across your scripts. Here's a quick rundown of the basics of strings in Python:

## Creating Strings


```python
# using single quotes
str1 = 'Hello World!'

# using double quotes
str2 = "Hello World!"
```

## Accessing Characters


```python
# access the first character
print(str1[0])

# access the last character
print(str1[-1])
```

## Slicing Strings


```python
# get a slice of characters from the string
print(str1[2:5])
```

## Concatenating Strings


```python
# using the plus operator
str3 = str1 + str2
print(str3)

# using the join method
str4 = " ".join([str1, str2])
print(str4)
```

## String Methods

Here are some of the most commonly used string methods:


```python
# lowercase
print(str1.lower())

# uppercase
print(str1.upper())

# replace
print(str1.replace("World", "Universe"))


# find
print(str1.find("World"))

# split
print(str1.split(" "))
```

## String Formatting


```python
# using f-strings (available in Python 3.6+)
name = "John"
print(f"Hello, {name}")

# using format method
print("Hello, {}".format(name))

# using % operator
print("Hello, %s" % name)
```

## Exercises

Question 5 is intentionally tricky and may require you to do a bit of research on your own to find a solution. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help!

1. Write a program that takes a name as input and greets the user using their name.
2. Write a program that takes the string `"Hello there!"` and prints the string in all uppercase letters.
3. Write a program that splits the string `"Let's split into groups."` into words and prints the result.
4. Write a program that takes the string `"I love blank!"` and replaces the word `blank` with `Python`.
5. Write a program that reverses the string `"Did Hannah see bees? Hannah did."`.
