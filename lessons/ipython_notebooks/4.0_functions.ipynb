    "Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that can be executed whenever you need to perform a specific task. They can take inputs and produce outputs, and are a powerful tool for organizing and simplifying your code. To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function, any parameters it takes (in parentheses), and a colon. The body of the function is indented below the definition. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:\n",

    "Try to refactor your previous project code to use functions! For example, your `Simple Calculator` project could be adapted to use functions for each operation. You can also try to refactor your `Grocery List` project to use functions. Refactoring code is a common practice in programming, and it is a great way to improve your code. Having reproducible code in functions will make it easier to reuse, test and debug your code, as well as reducing the chances of errors creeping in in the first place! It will also make your code more readable and easier to maintain, which is important for larger projects and projects with multiple collaborators.\n"
