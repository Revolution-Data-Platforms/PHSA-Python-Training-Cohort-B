    "Now we're delving into into the big wide world of external Python packages. This is the bread and butter of Python, and it's where you'll find most of the functionality you'll need to do anything useful. These packages are written by other people, and they're usually pretty good at what they do. The only downside is that you have to install them yourself, and you have to learn how to use them independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst these tutorials will give you a good overview of how to use the packages, you'll have to do a bit of research to find out how to do specific things. This is a good thing, because it means you'll be able to find the answers to your own questions, and you'll be able to use the packages in ways that the tutorials don't cover.\n",

    "Remember, the internet is your friend. If you're stuck, search engines are your best friend. If you can't find the answer to your question, try reaching out to your colleagues or your tutor.\n"
