    "Indexing in Python is the process of accessing a single item or a group of items from a collection, such as a list, tuple or string. In Python, the index of an item in a collection starts from `0`, not `1`. For example, the index of the first item in a list is `0`, the index of the second item in a list is `1`, and so on. \n",
